//== GIGAWATT: 'Git Great Applications Wrapper'
image::img/logo.png[float="right"]

== What is Gigawatt?
A boilerplate killer: create new software applications and place them under 'git' version control at the speed of light! 

=== What it exactly does?
+gigawatt+ handles automatically the boring steps needed to create a new application:

* generate the skeleton of the project using its plugins called *igniters*
** There are currently igniters for: +java+, +scala+, +groovy+, +javascript+ projects.
* add a context sensible +.gitignore+ file (using https://www.gitignore.io[gitignore.io API])
* place the project under +git+ version control on one of the following backends:
** https://github.com[Github]
** https://gitlab.com[Gitlab] (both public site and custom private installations)
** https://bitbucket.org[Bitbucket]
* publish code in your personal repository or as a group/team/organization member

=== How can I use it?
For a cold start just two steps are needed.

. Firstly add a new profile (e.g. work, personal, github...). It's a required step just the first time (or each time you need to add an addictional git backend):

 gigawatt add-profile my-profile-name
 
. Actually create the new project:

 gigawatt create great-app

and follow the instructions. +gigawatt+ has sensible defaults and asks something only if it's really needed (and usually just the first time).

=== How to install it?
Open your trusty bash shell and paste this:

 curl -sL http://bit.ly/get-gigawatt | bash
 
That's it!

=== Profiles
When you add your first profile, +gigawatt+ asks you some informations about your account to make possible upload code on the git backend. These informations will be stored in the git global register (usually placed under +~/.gitconfig+).

=== Igniters
The skeleton of the project are generated by one of the +gigawatt+ plugins called +igniters+.

An +igniter+ generate the project template and add an appropriate +.gitignore+ file. It usually rely mainly on an external generator (e.g., +gradle+, +yeoman+, +meteor+) according to the main language of the project. Anyway create a new igniter it's very simple process: it can be later enriched in functionalities (see for example the code of the +groovy-plus+ igniter).

=== Requirements
* +git+
* +bash+ (4.3+)
* +ssh+
* +curl+

=== Platforms

* Linux (works under any debian-based distribution)
