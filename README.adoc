//== GIGAWATT: 'Git Great Applications Wrapper'
image::img/logo.png[float="text-right"]

== What is Gigawatt?
A boilerplate killer: create new software applications and place them under 'git' version control at the speed of light! 

=== What it exactly does?
Handles automatically the boring steps needed to create a new application:

* generate the skeleton of the project using its plugins called *igniters*
** There are currently igniters for: +java+, +scala+, +groovy+, +javascript+ projects.
* add a context sensible +.gitignore+ file
** using https://www.gitignore.io[gitignore.io API]
* place the project under +git+ version control
** The following backends are currently supported: 
*** https://github.com[Github]
*** https://gitlab.com[Gitlab] (both public site and custom private installations)
//*** https://bitbucket.org[Bitbucket]
* publish code in your personal repository or as a group/organization member
* automatically handle the ssh keys procedures related to push code without any prompt

=== How can I use it?
For a cold start just two steps are needed.

. Firstly add a new git profile (e.g. work, personal, github...). It's a required step just the first time (or when you need to add addictional git backends):

 gigawatt add-profile my-profile-name
 
. Actually create the new project:

 gigawatt create great-app

and follow the instructions. 
+gigawatt+ has sensible defaults and asks only if it's really needed (and just the first time).

=== How to install it?
Open your trusty shell and paste this:

 curl -sL http://tinyurl.com/install-gigawatt | bash
 
That's it!

=== Profiles
When you add your first profile, +gigawatt+ asks you some informations about your git account to make possible upload code on the git backend. These informations will be stored in the git config global register (usually placed under +~/.gitconfig+).

=== Igniters
The skeleton of the project are generated by one of the +gigawatt+ plugins called +igniters+.

An +igniter+ generate the project template and add an appropriate +.gitignore+ file. It usually rely mainly on an external generator (e.g., +gradle+, +yeoman, +meteor+) according to the main language of the project but any kind of setup is possible (see for example the code of the +groovy-plus+ igniter).

=== Requirements
* +git+
* +bash+ (4.3+)
* +ssh+
* +curl+

=== Platforms

* Tested
** Linux (works under any debian-based distribution)
