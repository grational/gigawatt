//== GIGAWATT: 'Git Great Applications Wrapper'
image::img/logo.png[float="text-right"]

== What is Gigawatt?
A boilerplate killer to start new software applications and place them under 'git' version control at the speed of light! 

=== What it exactly does?
Handles automatically the boring steps usully encountered starting a new application:

* generate the skeleton of the project using its plugins called *igniters*
** There are currently igniters for: +java+, +scala+, +groovy+, +javascript+ projects.
* add a context sensible +.gitignore+ file
** using https://www.gitignore.io[gitignore.io API]
* place the project under +git+ version control
** The following backends are currently supported: 
*** https://github.com[Github]
*** https://gitlab.com[Gitlab] (both public site and custom private installations)
//*** https://bitbucket.org[Bitbucket]
* publish code in your personal repository or as a group/organization member
* automatically handle the ssh keys procedures related to push code without any prompt

=== How can I use it?
For a cold start just two steps are needed.

. Firstly add a new git profile (e.g. work, home, github...). It's required just the first time (or when you want to add an addictional git backend):

 gigawatt add-profile my-profile
 
. Actually create the new project:

 gigawatt create great-app      

and follow the instructions. +gigawatt+ has sensible defaults and asks only if it's really needed (and just the first time).

=== How to install it?
[source,bash]
----
echo 'export PATH="${HOME}/bin:${PATH}"' >> ~/.bashrc
mkdir ~/bin && cd ~/bin
git clone 'https://github.com/grecovery/gigawatt'
ln -s gigawatt/gigawatt
----
That's it!

=== Profiles
At the first execution +gigawatt+ asks you some informations about your git account to make possible upload code for you on your git backend. These informations will be stored in the git config global register (usually placed under +~/.gitconfig+).

=== Igniters
The skeletons of the projects are generated by on the several +gigawatt+ plugins called +igniters+.

An +igniter+ is responsible for the code generation and the generation of the +.gitignore+ file. It usually rely mainly on an external generator (e.g., +gradle+, +meteor+) but with the right bash skills any kind of setups is possible (see for example the +groovy-plus+ igniter).

=== Requirements
* +git+
* +bash+ (4.3+)
* +ssh+
* +curl+

=== Platforms

* Tested
** Linux (works under any debian-based distribution)
* Untested (yet!)
** OsX
** Cygwin
